|:------------:|-----------:|
|1 order|25|
|2 orders|28|
|3+ orders|71|

```sql
WITH order_counts AS (
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_count
        FROM dbt_yang_s.stg_orders
        GROUP BY user_id
    )
SELECT
    CASE WHEN order_count = 1 THEN '1'
    WHEN order_count = 2 THEN '2'
    WHEN order_count > 2 THEN '3+' END AS order_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM order_counts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

```

            COUNT( DISTINCT session_id ) AS COUNT
        FROM dbt_yang_s.stg_events
        GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT AVG(COUNT)
FROM unique_session_count_by_hour
